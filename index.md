The Internet is increasingly becoming a collection of closed platforms. A reliable exchange between them is a tough and complex endeavor for independent software developers and small teams.
</br>
<a href="https://github.com/homunkulo" title="Homunkulo GitHub" target="_blank">Homunkulo</a> is committed to find solutions for this increasing problem. Can machine learning help construct, maintain and sustain connections between closed platforms? Is there a format as ubiquitous as the spoken or written language, in which services and user can exchange data?
</br>
</br>
Our architecture is based on three cornerstones:
</br>
A format with which the problem domain can be described
</br>
A software that uses Machine Learning to compare this definition with the formats to be connected
</br>
Automatically generated software libraries which allow the user to connect services without knowing their specific implementation details
</br>
</br>
We use Python for the Machine Learning aspects and Go for the automated generation of code. Ideally, <a href="https://github.com/homunkulo" title="Homunkulo GitHub" target="_blank">Homunkulo</a> will be flexible enough to serve any target language.
